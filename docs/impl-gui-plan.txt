Plan:

A. Marking-local
  1. Open local project folder
  2. Open video folder on network folder
  3. Open existing project - import settings
  4. Fill in some typical params
  5. Run prep from dlc
  6. Auto-edit config-yaml
  7. Run WS-GUI, mark by hand
  8. Load marked images directly, check
  9. Create training set

B. Training-remote
  1. Enter addr-connect to ssh
  2. Open projects dir remotely, copy existing project folder
  3. Open video folder remotely
  4. Fill in some typical config params
  5. Auto-edit config2-yaml
  6. Run training remotely
  7. Run marking remotely
  8. Run evaluation remotely, plot statistics
  9. Copy trained videos and statistics to the network folder
  10. Close session, ensure GPU tasks closed

C. Marking-remote
  1. Open projects dir remotely, copy existing project folder
  2. Open video folder remotely
  3. Fill in some typical config params
  4. Auto-edit config2-yaml
  5. Run marking remotely
  6. Copy trained videos and statistics to the network folder
  
D. Postprocess-local
  1. Open projects folder on network drive
  2. Extract positions, lengths and angles
  3. Report statistics on bad frames (confidence vs bad distances)
  Optional: iterative-marking
    4. Filter all bad frames, extract some based on k-means
    5. Run WS-GUI, mark additional frames by hand
